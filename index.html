    <h3>Airline case study:</h3>
    <p>My client is a start-up airline. They are looking to create an online experience.
        Fast, easy and intuitive: one that based on a deep understanding of their target users.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>My task is to design a new website for my client.</li>
        <li>I will focus on the flight booking process: how users search for and select flights online.</li>
        <li>To do this, I will go through the full UX process.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My end goal is to design and build a clickable prototype. That is testable with users, along with a detailed set
        of wireframes.</p>
